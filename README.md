# Facekey Application

###Description

This is an OpenCV Java implementation POC, formed by three microservices. Main purpose of this project is producing a POC for a face recognition application with following capabilities; 

- Face **registration** with names
- **Training** to recognize and match those names and pictures of faces
- **Recognizing** a picture or a video of a face without name by using previously gathered information.

The application is distributed to three microservices, **registration, training and recognition**. 

Please don't forget this is an unfinished project which needs lots of work, which is made to play and have fun with OpenCV in 2019.
